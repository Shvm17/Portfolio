### **How This Works**

This system uses **Gitfolio** and **GitHub Actions** to automate the creation, update, and deployment of your portfolio:

1. **Scheduled Updates**: GitHub Actions runs every 10 minutes to ensure your portfolio stays updated.
2. **Effortless Deployment**: The workflow automatically deploys the updated portfolio to GitHub Pages, ensuring it's live 24/7.

### **Features**

- **Self-Updating & Automated Deployment**: The system automatically updates your portfolio every 10 minutes and deploys the changes to GitHub Pages, making it accessible online without manual intervention.
- **Easy Customization**: Customize your portfolio's layout and content by modifying Gitfolio's settings to match your personal style.

### **Why Choose This Approach?**

This setup eliminates the need for manual updates to your portfolio. GitHub Actions runs every 10 minutes to ensure your portfolio stays current with your GitHub, without any effort on your part!

### **Customization and Extensibility**

- **Custom Branch**: If you want to deploy from a branch other than `main` (e.g., `gh-pages`), simply adjust the workflow and GitHub Pages settings.
- **Customize Portfolio Layout**: Modify the `config.json` file to change the design, add sections, or filter repositories.
- **Frequent Updates**: Adjust the frequency of the GitHub Actions workflow if you need it to run more or less frequently.

       "includeFork": false,                // Include forked repositories: true or false
       "theme": "dark.css",                 // Theme choice: dark or light
       "types": ["owner"],                  // Repository types: owner, member, etc.
